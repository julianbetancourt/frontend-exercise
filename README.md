# ONTRUCK FRONT-END TEST

Welcome to the Ontruck front end test, we are so glad that you reached here and we are so gratefull for the time you are going to dedicate to this test. We hope that you don't invest more than a couple of hours to make it work and that you enjoy doing it.

## Objective

The objective of this test is that you show us your front end skills and more specifically your skills with the React framework, if the test meets our criteria we will have a technical interview where we can discuss the decissions taken in the test and get a bit deeper into your knowledge.

## So, what you need to do?

Given this [repository](https://github.com/ontruck/frontend-exercise) with a Create React App boilerplate we want you to implement a list of SW planets showing at least these properties: name, diameter, climate, population and terrain.

You will need to fetch the list of planets from [this public API](https://swapi.dev/) like "https://swapi.dev/api/planets" it will return a list of paginated planets with the desired properties.

Here it's a design about how we want it to look. [DESIGN](https://www.figma.com/file/7XKPqc9Yd4ns8fAu5XRq40/FE-Technical-Test?node-id=0%3A1)

### Main functionalities

- Make it responsive, it should look good in mobile and desktop.
- Fetch the data from the public api. It's ok to use a library like Axios, SWR or similar, up to you.
- Show the list of planets and their properties in each card.
- You don't need to care about pagination, it's ok to work with the first page of planets that the api returns.
- You need to implement a search box that should filter the list of planets by name from a string the user should type in an input field.

## Bonus functionalities (not required, just if you have the time)

- Tests
- More product complexity:
  - Mark planets as reviewed.
  - Sorting the list of planets by their properties.
  - Add more properties to search by at the search box.
  - Edit the planet information saving locally.
- Basic CI/CD funnel with free Github actions or similar.

### How would you share it?

We want you to fork this repo to your github account and push your code there, then you could share with us the link so we can check the code before the interview.

Extra points if you could make it available on Github pages ðŸ˜‰

## Final thoughts

Let us know if you have any major questions with the objective or the functionalities, although we want you to take your own decisions if you are able to back them up later in the interview.

Thank you for your time!

The Ontruck team.
